# E-Commerce Microservices Backend

## Project Overview

This project is a **production-grade backend system for a modern e-commerce platform**, designed with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of maintenance. The backend services will handle core e-commerce functionalities such as product management, user authentication, cart & order processing, and payment integration.

Inspired by platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, this project aims to showcase advanced backend engineering skills using the latest technologies and best practices in software development.
